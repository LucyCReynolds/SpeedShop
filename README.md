# SpeedShop
Google Hackathon at SWE15 Conference

SpeedShop was created at the Google-Powered Hackathon at WE15 in Nashville.
It is designed to be a shopping list and store map in one. 
Simply select the items you need when the app starts, and stars will appear on the map where your desired items are
Once you pick up an item, touch it on the list and the star will disappear.
Accidentally check off something you haven't picked up? Just touch it again and the star will reappear.
